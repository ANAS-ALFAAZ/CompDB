# CompDB
CompDB is a comprehensive database management system designed to streamline the handling of employee, client, and supplier data. The app provides an efficient way to manage and organize critical business information, ensuring seamless access and manipulation of data for improved business operations.
# Description
CompDB is an advanced Database Management System (DBMS) built using MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL to optimize the management of business-related data. The system is designed around a relational database schema with four tables dedicated to employees, branches, clients, and suppliers. By organizing and structuring data efficiently, CompDB enables businesses to handle large volumes of critical information with ease. The app incorporates all four CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to ensure smooth manipulation of employee and client data in real-time applications, improving overall data accuracy and accessibility.

The DBMS is designed for high performance, with optimized SQL queries for data retrieval, filtering, and aggregation, reducing query processing time significantly. This contributes to faster and more efficient data management across the system. Additionally, the development team worked collaboratively to document the database design and query structures, ensuring clarity and ease of use for future reference and integration. CompDB has been successfully deployed on GitHub, allowing for public access, collaboration, and continuous improvement within the open-source community.
